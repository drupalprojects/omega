# `OMEGA_SUBTHEME` Theme
><small>Welcome to `OMEGA_SUBTHEME`, your custom [**Omega Five**](https://drupal.org/project/omega) subtheme!

## Inline Documentation
> You'll find that the `OMEGA_SUBTHEME` theme has a vast coverage of inline documentation. 

### `README.md` files 
It really _behooves_ you to read, at least once, any `README.md` you come across in your theme.
Many of these files could become, and likely should evolve from your own edits, into a resource you use frequently. 
Where appropriate and possible, the documentation is updated with your specific theme name and information.

> At the very minimum, each directory of your subtheme should contain a `README.md` file which should include:
* A brief overview of the intention of a directory 

> And can also include:
* Advanced Code Samples
* Example Usage Information
* Reference Links & Resources
* etc.

### Code Documentation
Where possible, and as a continuing effort, code for [**Omega Five**](https://drupal.org/project/omega) is well documented inline.
