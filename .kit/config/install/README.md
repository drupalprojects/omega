## `config/install` Directory

Default Configuration for an extension

An extension (module, theme, or profile) that provides default values for its configuration must put that configuration into YAML files in its `config/install` sub-directory.

If the extension only needs basic Simple Configuration settings, all of the default configuration could go into one themename.settings.yml file. 
For more complex settings, you can separate your configuration into multiple files. 
Configuration Entities must each be put into their own YAML files, and they should be generated by having the module write out its configuration (don't try writing them by hand).
